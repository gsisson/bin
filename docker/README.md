# flask-demo
Simple hello world app

#### Setup instructions:
1. pip install -r requirements.txt
2. python /app/app.py
3. http://localhost:5000/hello



#### Homework:
1. Create a Dockerfile for the application here - I'd suggest starting with the official [Python docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/python) as a base.
2. Build the image
3. Push the image into ECR or hub.docker.com
4. Validate running the container locally and accessing it via web browser (e.g. expose the web port)
